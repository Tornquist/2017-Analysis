# 2017 Analysis

This repository contains a dataset relating to all of the time I spent on
engineering-related projects in 2017 and a Jupyter notebook containing my
analysis of that time.

To see more, click on the Jupyter notebook in the file list above, or
click [here](./2017-Analysis.ipynb). If you are on a desktop the notebook should
render immediately. If you are using a phone, you may have to request the desktop
version.

If you would like to see the results without sorting through the code that
generates them, there is [a post on my blog](http://nathantornquist.com/blog/2018/02/2017-work-analysis/)
 with just the graphs.
